# ObjectDetection_MLKit
Object Detection using firebase MLKit

- Firebase ML Kit is a mobile SDK from Google for both Android and iOS which allows using machine learning in your apps. There’s also no need to have any machine learning knowledge to get started! ML Kit comes with a set of ready to use APIs for common use cases and it just takes a few lines of code to implement these APIs into your apps.

- The object detection and tracking service can detect and track multiple objects in an image, so they can be located and classified in real time. A maximum of eight objects can be detected and tracked concurrently. The following object categories are supported: household products, fashion goods, food, places, plants, faces, and others.

- In this project we are going to focus on “Object Detection and Tracking” and build a simple Android application on Android Studio which detects objects in static mode.
